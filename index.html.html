<br><H2>KOALA BEAR<BR>
<P><I>The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia.<BR> It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats.<BR> The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.<br> It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose.<br> The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb). Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown.<br> Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south.<br> These populations possibly are separate subspecies, but this is disputed.</I>
